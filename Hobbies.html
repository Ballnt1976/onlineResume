    <hr />
    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>My hobbies paint a vibrant picture of a dynamic and passionate life. Running, for instance, isn’t just a physical activity for me—it’s a way to make a difference in the world. I’ve participated in various runs for meaningful causes, including charities like Make-A-Wish. From challenging myself with 10k runs and half-marathons to conquering the iconic London Marathon, my dedication shines through. Running for a purpose not only enhances my fitness but also uplifts countless lives, proving that my strides truly go the extra mile.</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>Gaming offers me a beloved escape into countless worlds filled with creativity and strategy. It’s more than just a pastime; it’s a medium for storytelling, community-building, and self-expression. Whether I’m embarking on epic quests, solving intricate puzzles, or collaborating with friends online, gaming allows me to explore new perspectives and hone valuable skills like problem-solving and teamwork. The ability to unwind while immersing myself in these digital adventures makes gaming a cherished part of my life.</p>
<h2>Model Trains</h2>
<p>Model trains, particularly in the HO gauge, bring a therapeutic and artistic element to my hobbies. There’s something deeply satisfying about designing intricate layouts, recreating miniature worlds, and bringing them to life with detailed locomotives and scenery. It’s a hands-on way for me to unwind and channel my creativity. The precision and care required to build and maintain these models create a calming rhythm, allowing me to focus and relax. Whether it’s the nostalgia of railways or the joy of perfecting a masterpiece, model trains offer me a unique sense of fulfillment.</p>
